# Code of Conduct v2.1

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the iChan community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.

## Our Open Source Community Strives to:

- **Be Friendly and Patient:** Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- **Be Welcoming:** Support people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be Considerate:** Understand that your work impacts others and consider the consequences of your decisions.
- **Be Respectful:** Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. Always be respectful and courteous.
- **Choose Words Carefully:** Conduct yourself professionally. Avoid:
  - Violent threats or language
  - Discriminatory jokes and language
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
  - Doxing (posting others' personal information)
  - Personal insults
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors
  - Repeated harassment (if someone asks you to stop, then stop)
- **Understand When Disagreeing:** Resolve disagreements constructively and respectfully.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. We honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting us via [zchandev@gmail.com](mailto:zchandev@gmail.com). All reports will be handled with discretion.

Please include:
- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved, along with witnesses
- A detailed account of what occurred
- Any additional information that may be helpful

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. A representative may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from the community.

## Thanks

This Code of Conduct is based on the [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct) from the [TODOGroup](http://todogroup.org). We are thankful for their work and all the communities who have paved the way with codes of conduct.
